# HTML Template for p5.js Game Publishing

This template provides a simple setup for publishing p5.js games. It includes the necessary HTML and CSS files along with a starter `game.js` file to get you started quickly.

## Getting Started

1. **Coding Your Game**

   - Begin coding your game in the `game.js` file.
   - Make sure not to rename this file unless you are confident about updating any related references.
   - Feel free to modify the canvas size, background color, and any other settings in `game.js` ‚Äî the provided code is a first starting point.

2. **Changing the Browser Title**

   - To change the title that appears in the browser tab, open the `index.html` file.
   - Locate line 6:
     ```html
     <title>Foundations of Programming</title>
     ```
   - Replace **only** the text between `<title>` and `</title>` with your desired title.

## Publishing Your Game on GitHub Pages

1. **Committing Your Code**

   - Once you've finished coding, make sure your latest version is committed to GitHub.

2. **Enabling GitHub Pages**

   - Go to **Settings** in your GitHub repository.
   - On the left sidebar, click **Pages**.
   - Under the **Branch** section, select the `main` branch from the dropdown menu, then click **Save**.

3. **Waiting for Deployment**
   - It may take a moment for GitHub Pages to deploy your site. You can check the deployment status under **Actions** in the top menu.
   - Once deployed, you can access your game at `https://ju-nmd2024.github.io/<your-repository-name>`.

Happy coding üêπ!
